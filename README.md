This is my first independent project for my boot.dev course. The goal is to create a videogame database for videogame collection.
This will include:
- text based interface
- adding/removing/editing games to the database
- sorting and searching by name
- color coded genre and platform
- saving to file (in .CSV)

Future goals to potentially include:
- web querying for review scores
- gui
- cover art
- phone app with remote access to database

The future goals will be dependent on progression through the boot.dev courses (we haven't covered these topics yet) or my 
available free time to self study these features.
